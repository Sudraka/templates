#+title: Templates

A few useful templates I have written myself or collected from different sources and modified.

Titles are self explanatory.
- Those starting with emacs-org are for using in org-mode of Emacs. They are mostly capture templates
- Those starting with emacs-yasnippet are snippets made by me.
